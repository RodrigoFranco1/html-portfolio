<hr />

<h3>The Green Book</h3>
<p>
  That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there's
  an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it. We made a deal.
  That's right. Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an
  understanding. Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making
  that every week. That's right. Two pounds a week, thirty-five thousand a
  pound.

<h3>The Gentelman</h3>
<p>
  Look, I'll give you Jesse Pinkman, OK? Like you said, he's the problem, he's
  always been the problem and without him, we would... and he's in town,
  alright? He's not in Virginia or wherever the hell you're looking for him.
  He's right here in Albuquerque and I can take you to him, I'll take you right
  to him. What do you say?

<h3>Kingsman - The golden circle</h3>
<p>
  Did he speak to you? Would you just answer? What things? What people? A month
  ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us. And now, he pulls you out of the lab
  and employs you as... what... a, an assistant gunman? A tough guy? Does that
  make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. What kind of game is
  he playing. Does he think you're that na√Øve? He can't truly think that you'd
  forget... let alone Gale, let alone Victor... and all the horror that goes
  along with all of that.
